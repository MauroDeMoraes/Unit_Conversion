User story:

As an user, I want to be able to convert the following units in a web application:

- fahrenheit to celcius (and vice-verse)
- kilometers to miles (and vice-verse)
- meters to feet (and vice-verse)
- inches to centimeters (and vice-verse)

Acceptance criteria:

- Use git/github for version control (share with me the name of the repository so I can follow your progress)
- Deploy and host your app on [netlify.com](http://netlify.com). *It's free.* ðŸ˜‰

- You can design your app the way you wish. You can also use frontend libraries such as bootstrap ([https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/)). *It's free and easy to set up. This will save you tons of time on the frontend.*

P.S: Do some research before start coding the app. Explore different ways a converter web app can be built and pick a method that suits best for you. Don't be shy in checking out somebody else code! 

P.S.: Don't skip the design step! Draw (even if on a piece of paper) how you wish you app look like. This will help you wonders when you start building the frontend.
